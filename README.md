# Whirlpool Bot

A trading bot for automated liquidity provision and rebalancing on Orca Whirlpools on the Solana blockchain.

## Overview

This bot automates liquidity provision for Orca Whirlpools by:
- Opening positions in specified liquidity pools
- Monitoring prices at regular intervals
- Rebalancing positions when they go out of range
- Managing wallet balances and swapping tokens when needed

The bot is designed to maintain an active position around the current market price, allowing you to earn trading fees continuously even as prices fluctuate.

## Features

- üí∞ Automated liquidity provision
- üîÑ Price-based position rebalancing
- üí± Automatic token swapping when needed
- üìä Support for custom price range percentages
- üåê Mainnet and Devnet support
- üìà Detailed logging of all operations

## Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Solana CLI tools
- A Solana wallet with SOL and your target tokens
- Access to a Solana RPC endpoint

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lhermoso/whirlpool_bot.git
cd whirlpool_bot
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your RPC endpoints:
```
RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
RPC_DEV_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

2. Place your Solana wallet keypair in a file named `wallet.json` in the project root (or specify a different path with the CLI arguments).

## Usage

The bot can be run using the following command structure:

```bash
cargo run --release -- --pool-address <POOL_ADDRESS> [OPTIONS]
```

### Required Arguments

- `--pool-address <ADDRESS>`: The address of the Whirlpool pool to trade on

### Optional Arguments

- `--keypair-path <PATH>`: Path to your Solana keypair file (default: `wallet.json`)
- `--position-mint-address <ADDRESS>`: Mint address of an existing position (optional)
- `--interval <SECONDS>`: Polling interval in seconds (default: 60)
- `--invest <AMOUNT>`: Amount of SOL to invest in the pool (default: 1.0)
- `--range-percentage <PERCENTAGE>`: Price range as a percentage (default: 2.0, means ¬±1% from current price)
- `--network <NETWORK>`: Solana network to use, either "mainnet" or "devnet" (default: mainnet)

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Invest 1 SOL in the specified pool with default settings
cargo run --release -- --pool-address Czfq3xZZ123456789ABCDEFG
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Invest 0.5 SOL with a 5% range, checking every 30 seconds on devnet
cargo run --release -- \
  --pool-address Czfq3xZZ123456789ABCDEFG \
  --invest 0.5 \
  --range-percentage 5.0 \
  --interval 30 \
  --network devnet
```

## Bot Monitoring and Auto-Restart

The bot comes with a monitoring script that automatically restarts it if it crashes or stops running. This is especially useful for long-term, unattended operation.

### Using the Monitor Script

1. The script is located at the root of the project directory: `monitor_whirlpool_bot.sh`

2. Make it executable (if not already):
   ```bash
   chmod +x monitor_whirlpool_bot.sh
   ```

3. Edit the script to configure your desired bot parameters:
   ```bash
   # Open the file
   nano monitor_whirlpool_bot.sh
   
   # Update the BOT_CMD line with your preferred parameters
   BOT_CMD="cargo run --release -- --pool-address YOUR_POOL_ADDRESS --interval 120 --invest 0.15"
   ```

4. Run the script directly to test:
   ```bash
   ./monitor_whirlpool_bot.sh
   ```

### Setting Up Automatic Monitoring with Crontab

To have your system automatically check and restart the bot if needed:

1. Open your crontab for editing:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add a line to run the check every 5 minutes (adjust timing as needed):
   ```
   */5 * * * * /full/path/to/whirlpool_bot/monitor_whirlpool_bot.sh
   ```

3. Save and exit the editor

The script will:
- Check if the bot is running
- Start it if it's not running
- Log all actions to `bot_monitor.log` in the project directory
- Keep stdout/stderr output in `bot.log`

### Monitoring Logs

You can monitor the bot's activity through the log files:

```bash
# Monitor script logs
tail -f bot_monitor.log

# Bot output logs
tail -f bot.log
```

## How It Works

The bot follows these steps:

1. **Initial Position**: Opens a position in the specified pool with your investment amount.
2. **Price Monitoring**: Continuously monitors the current price at the specified interval.
3. **Range Check**: Determines if the current price is within your position's range.
4. **Rebalancing**: If the price moves out of range, the bot:
   - Closes your existing position
   - Opens a new position centered around the current price
   - Uses the same percentage range for the new position

## Wallet Balance Management

The bot includes smart wallet balance management:
- Maintains a gas reserve (0.05 SOL) for transaction fees
- Can swap between pool tokens to ensure sufficient balance for operations
- Displays current wallet and position balances

## What Is A Whirlpool?

Orca Whirlpools are concentrated liquidity pools on Solana, similar to Uniswap v3 on Ethereum. They allow liquidity providers to specify price ranges for their assets, offering potentially higher capital efficiency compared to traditional constant product pools.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Insufficient SOL**: Ensure your wallet has enough SOL for both investment and transaction fees.
- **RPC Errors**: If you encounter RPC errors, try using a different RPC endpoint in your `.env` file.
- **Position Creation Failures**: Some pools may have restrictions or may not be properly initialized. Try with a different pool.

### Specific Error Solutions

#### "String is the wrong size" Error

This error typically occurs due to one of these reasons:

1. **Invalid Pool Address**: The Whirlpool pool address is malformed or doesn't point to a valid Whirlpool pool
   - Solution: Double-check your pool address. It should be a valid Solana public key (base58 encoded, typically 32-44 characters)
   - Make sure you're using an address from a real Whirlpool pool on the network you selected (mainnet/devnet)

2. **Wrong Network**: You're trying to access a mainnet pool on devnet or vice versa
   - Solution: Verify you're using the correct `--network` parameter matching the pool address

3. **RPC Connection Issues**: The RPC endpoint can't properly retrieve the pool data
   - Solution: Try a different RPC endpoint in your `.env` file or check if your current endpoint is rate-limiting you

#### "Failed to deserialize Whirlpool" Error

This means the address doesn't point to a valid Whirlpool pool:

1. **Check the pool exists**: Use Solana Explorer to verify the address exists
2. **Verify ownership**: The account should be owned by the Orca Whirlpools program
3. **Network mismatch**: Make sure you're on the right network (mainnet/devnet)

#### Token Mint Errors

If you see errors related to token mints:

1. **Check token balances**: Ensure your wallet has the tokens required by the pool
2. **Correct network**: Verify you're on the correct network (some tokens exist only on mainnet)

### Logs

The bot provides detailed logs of all operations. To increase log verbosity, set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --release -- --pool-address <POOL_ADDRESS>
```

## Finding Valid Whirlpool Addresses

To find valid Whirlpool addresses:

1. **Orca App**: Visit [Orca's app](https://www.orca.so/) and explore pools
2. **Solana Explorer**: Look for accounts owned by the Orca Whirlpools program
3. **Orca API**: Use Orca's API to get a list of valid pools

Example of a valid pool address format: `CJFCFqVRtMJtbY7VAdREPK23XFbp9GEpS6FbfPWvZbm5`
